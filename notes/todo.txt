TODO:
- Keep improving speed
- A database for recording user requests
- Trace computation and time cost (also record in DB?)
- logger for tracing status and errors
- Scene classification: make hashtags?
- Sentient analysis?
- Mandarin ASR

Issues:
- The system will go down when analysing audio if the duration is too long (about 3G for 10 min video)
  - Increasing the mem that the container allow to use is one solution
  - Guess tracking the memory usage is the most important task now.

DONE:
- Replace current VAD with a SED (sound event detector)
- ASR scripts multiprocessing

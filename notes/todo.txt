TODO:
- improve speed

- record requests history
  - trace computation and time cost
  - trace status and errors

- Scene classification: make hashtags?

- NLP
  - Sentient analysis? 
  - Summary of contents?

Issues:
- The system will go down when analysing audio if the duration is too long (about 3G for 10 min video)
  - Increasing the mem that the container allow to use is one solution
  - Guess tracking the memory usage is the most important task now.

DONE:
- Replace current VAD with a SED (sound event detector)
- ASR scripts multiprocessing
